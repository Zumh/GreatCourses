## Best way to study by Navy Seal

- Increasing the time between practice sessions-called expanding retrieval review-is the most efficient approach to building long-term memory (Cull et al., 1996).

- Use fill-in-the-blank questions to promote recall rather than multiple choice questions that only require recognition (Glover, 1989). Even though initial performance is not as high with recall tests as it is with recognition tests, long-term retention will be much better (Carpenter & DeLosh, 2006).

- For subjects where content is organized by theme-for example, vocabulary lists in foreign language courses-question sets should include vocabulary from a variety of lists rather than just one. So essentially if learning a language, don't just have a deck for 'colours' and another for 'emotions' but mix them together.

- Avoid listening to music while you are studying. The lyrics will compete with the words you are reading and make it difficult to comprehend them. The only exception to this rule is when there is distracting background noise-in this case, instrumental music (i.e., music without lyrics) can help to block out the noise (Dobbs et al.,2011)

- Make connections between new material and what they already know. When reviewing previously learned material (using retrieval practice), make connections between it and material they are currently in the process of learning. Have a review of your old cards which are memorised well and incorporate the information into new information you have learned. Make the cards increasingly complex once you have learned the underlying information.
